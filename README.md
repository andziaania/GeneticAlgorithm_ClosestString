Abstract:
Having a set of n strings S = {s1,s2, ..., sn}, each of length
L and over alphabet A, the Closest String Problem (CSP) searches for
a string s that is within the smallest Hamming distance d to each
s_i. This problem is NP-complete.

CSP has been extensively studied in computational biology and coding 
theory. One of the targets is to design a new DNA or amino acids
sequence that is very similar to each given sequence. The sample 
applications are PCR prime design, genetic probe design, motif finding
and antisense drug design.

In this work we present how the Simple Genetic Algorithm with
use of schemata, performs in finding the Closest String.
